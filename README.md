# Sorting-Algorithm
Different sorting algorithms implemented generically for long, float and string types with their time complexities.

## IDE used:
- Visual Studio

## Description:
The details are as follows:
-	User can choose which type of data he wants to sort. The data type choices will be:
    - long
    -	float
    -	string
-	User will then select the algorithm he wants to use for sorting. The choices are: 
    -	Quick sort
    -	Merge sort
    -	Radix sort
    -	Selection sort
    -	All sorts at a time
-	The user will also select whether he/she want to sort in ascending order or descending order
-	The user will then give the input. Maximum size of the input is 100 items.
-	After the input has been given, the following should be shown on the screen as output: the input array, results of sorted array (asc or desc), and time complexity.
-	User must be able to choose multiple sorting algorithms at a time. In this case, the time complexity of each selected algorithm will be shown.
